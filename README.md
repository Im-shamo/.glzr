# Glazewm-configs

Personal configuration of **Glzewm** and **Zebar**.

I have written a few scripts to add in some features that aren't in glazewm.

Zebar has not been customized yet as I am unfamiliar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Personal Scripts
### Description
- My own implememtation of workspace focus
  - Normal focus if workspace to be focus is on the monintor currently focused.
  - If the workpace to be focus is on another monitor,
    the scripts moves it to the monitor currently focused
    and swap if it is top on another monitor.

- Workspace swapping between Monitors
  - Swaps workspace between monitors
